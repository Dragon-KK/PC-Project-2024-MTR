A socket is just an endpoint for communication
A nice analogy to network communication is communication with cups and string
A socket is just a cup. One can create a socket for speaking out messages to listeners or create a socket for receiving messages

Usually creating connections goes as follows:
    -Machine1 listens on some address and awaits connections
    -Machine2 sends a request to this address asking for a connection
    -Machine1 creates a socket and allows for communication with machine2's socket
