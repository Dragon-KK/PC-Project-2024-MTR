Standard top view batlle royal where your score is based on how long you survive
I'm thinking we'll allow for 1 main weapon and three skill slots
After certain intervals of time the playing area gets smaller and players will be allowed to upgrade one of their abilities
The main weapon shall be controlled by the mouse and each skill will have some unique interaction

Some examples of weapons are:
    -- A mouse guided rocket (Once you shoot a new rocket you lose control of the old rocket)
    -- A laser gun that takes time to charge up 
    -- A machine gun
    
Some examples of skills are:
    -- A passive skill to recover health when not moving
    -- A passive skill to increase movement speed
    -- An ability to place mirrored walls (Can synergise with the laser gun)
    -- A teleportation ability

This kind of a system will allow us to add depth to the game (We are limited only by our ability to code out everything in time)
