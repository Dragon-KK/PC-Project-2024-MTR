I have some experience with socket programming, I made a rather crude pong game (https://github.com/Dragon-KK/ComputerProject2021) that can be played between two different computers on the same network back in school
Looking at it now I made a few decisions that I'll make differently right now. I want to see how to properly going about doing things like this.
Also I want to get experience in working in a team.
(I also don't have any PORs and now am getting massive fomo)
As for my weaknesses, at times I just feel unmotivated and lazy. I kinda just stop existing for a few days when that happens :D

I don't have any other commitments except for acads (which I'll prolly take lite). I'll have more than enough time to work on this project :)
