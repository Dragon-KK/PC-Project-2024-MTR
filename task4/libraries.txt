    For graphics we can use OpenGL, this allows for interaction with cross platform low level apis
    Another nice option is to use Qt for graphics.

    I'd suggest we use cpp to code out the game as there are very nice libraries such as `https://github.com/mas-bandwidth/yojimbo` to handle networking
    `https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets` is also a good option
